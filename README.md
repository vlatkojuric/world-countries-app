### What I learned

I learn a lot with every project I build,but this project taught me a lot of patience,research on things that I do not fully understand,and how important it is to do research and how it is possible to learn as you go.

On this project I learned to to create a Custom Hook to fetch data from the API I used anywhere in my project that I need and saved my self a lot of trouble,and of course you can never get enough of learning CSS to make your website look prettier.

All in all ,awesome project,looking forward to the next one,maybe in the future,I will do improvements on this project too,but for now I am happy how it turned out and look to start a fresh one,to learn more new awesome things.
